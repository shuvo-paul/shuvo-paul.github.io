#### [CO.FUND](https://co.fund/)
I have worked as a Front-End Developer at [co.fund](https://co.fund/). We used SASS version of Foundation 5 with SLIM Template. The challenging task was to work with different types of layout and make them responsive. To make some smoothly behavior I wrote custom JS. It was great to work with some cool developers :)
