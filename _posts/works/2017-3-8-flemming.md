#### [FLEMMING](http://works.thelazycoders.com/flemming/home.html)
It was a PSD to HTML conversion task. I have converted total 6 pages. My client preferred to use SASS version of Foundation 6. We used foundations' native plugins for dropdown, modals, slider, etc. We used [dataTable](https://datatables.net/) plugin for our tabular data and [fancybox 3](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/) for gallery. While a user start typing in search box a list will be appeared. We used jQuery UI to get this. All pages are fully responsive and cross browser compatible.
